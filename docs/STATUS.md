# Status board

Cap: 150 lines. Edited only by the merge role, in a board PR after each merge, from the merged
PR's "Board and log" section. History rolls to `docs/archive/status_<month>.md`.

## Phase
Current phase: **0 — Foundations** (gate: CI proves it rejects a lowered floor, a missing suite,
an untyped declaration and a planted secret). Gate signer: the lead.

## Agents

| Agent | State | Item | Branch / PR | Since |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| Lead | awaiting director | kickoff + greybox slice | main | 2026-10-16 |

States: working · running a check · awaiting director · blocked · available.

## Assigned items (in order; an item starts only when it is listed here)

### Phase 0
1. Lead: push the scaffold, make the repo private or public per the director, protect `main`
   (`test`, `doc-caps`, `gitleaks` required; squash only; delete branch on merge).
2. Lead: `project.godot` with the autoload list and typing warnings as errors; the smoke suite
   green; the harness self-test green.
3. Lead: the deliberately broken PRs (lowered floor, unregistered suite, untyped script, planted
   `KAIJU_TEST_SECRET_` key); each must go red. Record the result in `docs/audits/`.
4. Lead: the document pack from the playbook kickoff checklist (vision, engine, machine, team,
   guardrails, style bibles, pipeline, roadmap, repo, licence register, open questions).

### Done ahead of the gate (director asked to "build" the game, 2026-10-16)
- `project.godot`, autoloads, typing as errors; smoke 11, sim 28, flow 9 checks green locally.
- Greybox playable loop: species select (3), voxel rampage with army, results, evolution tree
  (19 nodes, 3 evolutions), versioned save. Captures in `docs/captures/2026-10-16-greybox/`.
- Still open in Phase 0: the deliberately broken PRs; the rest of the document pack.
